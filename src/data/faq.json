      "question": "What hydration is best for Neapolitan pizza?",
      "answer": "Traditional Neapolitan pizza uses 60-65% hydration. This creates a soft, pliable dough that chars beautifully in a high-temperature oven (800-900°F). If you're new to pizza making, start at 60% and work your way up as you get more comfortable."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use bread flour instead of 00 flour?",
      "answer": "Yes! Bread flour works well for pizza, especially New York and Detroit styles. It has higher protein content (12-14%) which creates a chewier texture. For Neapolitan, 00 flour is preferred for its finer grind and lower protein, but bread flour is a solid substitute."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is my pizza dough sticky?",
      "answer": "Sticky dough is usually caused by too much water (high hydration) or under-kneading. Try reducing hydration by 2-3%, or knead for a few more minutes until the dough becomes smooth and less tacky. Also, make sure your flour is fresh - old flour absorbs less water."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long should I cold ferment pizza dough?",
      "answer": "Cold fermentation (fridge at 38-40°F) typically takes 24-72 hours. 24 hours is the minimum for flavor development. 48-72 hours produces more complex flavors and better browning. Dough can be held up to 5 days, but may become harder to stretch."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between poolish and biga?",
      "answer": "Poolish is a liquid pre-ferment (100% hydration) that produces a more open crumb and mild, slightly tangy flavor. Biga is stiff (50-60% hydration) and creates a more complex, wheaty flavor with a tighter crumb structure. Both improve flavor and dough extensibility."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I freeze pizza dough?",
      "answer": "Yes! After the dough balls are shaped, wrap tightly in plastic and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then bring to room temperature (1-2 hours) before stretching. Frozen dough may be slightly less extensible."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why use baker's percentages?",
      "answer": "Baker's percentages express all ingredients relative to flour weight (flour = 100%). This makes scaling recipes easy - just multiply the flour weight and everything else scales proportionally. It also helps you compare recipes and understand the ratios that make each style unique."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I adjust for humid weather?",
      "answer": "In humid conditions, flour absorbs moisture from the air, effectively increasing your hydration. Reduce water by 2-3% (our calculator has a humidity toggle for this). You may also need to extend bulk fermentation time as humid dough ferments faster."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between instant and active dry yeast?",
      "answer": "Instant yeast (also called rapid-rise or bread machine yeast) can be mixed directly into flour. Active dry yeast needs to be dissolved in warm water first and requires 25% more than instant yeast for the same rise. Our calculator automatically adjusts the amount when you select your yeast type in Advanced Options."
    },
    {
      "question": "What water temperature should I use?",
      "answer": "Water temperature affects fermentation speed. For cold ferments (24-72 hours), use cold water (55-60°F / 13-16°C) to slow down yeast activity. For quick same-day doughs, use warm water (100-110°F / 38-43°C) to speed up the rise. Room temperature water works for medium ferments."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much salt should I use in pizza dough?",
      "answer": "Most pizza doughs use 2-3% salt (baker's percentage). Salt strengthens gluten, controls fermentation, and adds flavor. Too little salt makes dough slack and bland; too much inhibits yeast and makes the dough tough. Start with 2.5% and adjust to taste."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does my dough shrink back when I stretch it?",
      "answer": "Dough that springs back is under-proofed or the gluten is too tight. Let it rest 15-30 more minutes at room temperature to relax the gluten. Also, avoid overworking the dough - handle it gently and let gravity do most of the stretching."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a pizza oven to make great pizza?",
      "answer": "No! While pizza ovens reach 800-900°F for authentic Neapolitan pizza, home ovens at 500-550°F can make excellent pizza. Use a pizza steel or stone, preheat for at least 45 minutes, and position the rack at the top. For Detroit and pan pizzas, a standard oven works perfectly."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best way to measure flour - by weight or volume?",
      "answer": "Always measure by weight using a digital kitchen scale. Cup measurements can vary by 20-30% depending on how flour is scooped. A $15 digital scale is the single best investment for consistent dough. Our calculator provides weights in grams and ounces."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know when my dough has proofed enough?",
      "answer": "Well-proofed dough will have roughly doubled in size and feel light and airy. The poke test works well: press a floured finger into the dough. If it springs back slowly and leaves a slight indent, it's ready. If it springs back quickly, it needs more time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I make pizza dough without yeast?",
      "answer": "Yes, using sourdough starter or baking powder. Sourdough pizza requires a mature starter and longer fermentation (8-24 hours) but produces complex flavors. For quick results, some recipes use baking powder, though this creates a different texture than yeast-leavened dough."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use all-purpose flour for pizza dough?",
      "answer": "Yes, all-purpose flour works for pizza dough and is a good starting point for beginners. It has moderate protein (10-12%), which produces a softer, more tender crust than bread flour. It's ideal for thin and crispy styles but may not develop as much chew for New York-style. For best results, look for unbleached all-purpose flour, which has slightly more protein and better flavor."
    },
    {
      "question": "What temperature should pizza dough be when shaping?",
      "answer": "Pizza dough should be at room temperature (65-75°F / 18-24°C) before shaping. Cold dough straight from the fridge is too tight and will spring back when stretched. Remove your dough balls from the refrigerator 1-2 hours before you plan to shape them, and let them rest covered on the counter until they feel soft and pliable."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long can I cold ferment pizza dough?",
      "answer": "Most pizza dough can be cold fermented in the refrigerator for 1 to 5 days. The sweet spot for flavor and texture is typically 48-72 hours. Beyond 5 days, the dough may over-ferment, becoming overly sour, difficult to stretch, and prone to tearing. If you need to store it longer, freezing is a better option."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is my pizza dough too elastic and won't stretch?",
      "answer": "Overly elastic dough that snaps back is usually caused by tight gluten that hasn't had time to relax. Let the dough rest at room temperature for 20-30 minutes before trying again. Other causes include using high-protein flour, over-kneading, or shaping the dough while it's still cold from the fridge."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best pizza stone or pizza steel?",
      "answer": "A pizza steel is generally the best choice for home ovens because steel conducts heat 18 times faster than stone, giving you a crispier, more charred crust in less time. A 3/8-inch thick steel plate is ideal. Pizza stones work well too and are more affordable — choose one at least 1/2-inch thick for better heat retention. Preheat either option for at least 45-60 minutes at your oven's maximum temperature."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I convert a recipe to baker's percentages?",
      "answer": "Divide the weight of each ingredient by the total flour weight, then multiply by 100. For example, if a recipe uses 500g flour and 325g water, the hydration is (325 / 500) x 100 = 65%. Do this for every ingredient and you'll have a complete baker's percentage formula that's easy to scale up or down. Our calculator uses baker's percentages natively, so you can plug in any style's ratios directly."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does hydration mean in pizza dough?",
      "answer": "Hydration is the ratio of water to flour expressed as a percentage. A dough with 65% hydration has 65g of water for every 100g of flour. Lower hydration (55-60%) produces a stiffer, easier-to-handle dough with a denser crumb. Higher hydration (65-75%) creates a wetter, stickier dough that yields a lighter, more open crumb with bigger air pockets."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I make pizza dough ahead of time?",
      "answer": "Absolutely — making dough ahead of time actually improves it. A slow, cold fermentation in the refrigerator develops deeper flavor and better texture than a quick same-day rise. Prepare your dough 1-3 days before you need it, portion it into balls, and store them in lightly oiled, sealed containers in the fridge. Just remember to pull them out 1-2 hours before shaping."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does my pizza dough not rise?",
      "answer": "The most common cause is dead or expired yeast — check the expiration date and proof your yeast in warm water (100-110°F) with a pinch of sugar to confirm it's active. Other causes include water that was too hot (above 120°F kills yeast), too much salt added directly on top of yeast, or a cold environment that slows fermentation significantly. Make sure your dough is in a warm spot (75-80°F) for the bulk rise."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between Neapolitan and New York pizza dough?",
      "answer": "Neapolitan dough is simpler — just flour, water, salt, and yeast — with lower hydration (60-65%) and uses finely milled 00 flour. It's baked at extremely high temperatures (800-900°F) for 60-90 seconds. New York dough adds olive oil and sugar, uses bread flour or high-gluten flour, runs slightly higher hydration (63-68%), and bakes at lower temperatures (500-550°F) for 8-12 minutes, producing a chewier, foldable slice."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get a crispy pizza crust at home?",
      "answer": "The keys to a crispy home crust are maximum heat and a good baking surface. Preheat your oven to its highest setting (500-550°F) with a pizza steel or stone on the top rack for at least 45 minutes. Use a lower hydration dough (55-62%), stretch it thin, and don't overload the toppings. For extra crispiness, brush the bottom of the crust lightly with olive oil before baking."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I use olive oil in pizza dough?",
      "answer": "It depends on the style. Olive oil adds tenderness, flavor, and a slightly golden color to the crust. New York, Detroit, and thin-and-crispy styles typically include 2-5% olive oil. Traditional Neapolitan dough does not use oil, keeping the dough lean for that characteristic puff and char. If you want a softer, more forgiving dough that's easier to stretch, a small amount of oil helps."
