        <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed">
          The Pizza Dough Formula is a participant in affiliate programs, including the Amazon
          Services LLC Associates Program, designed to provide a means for sites to earn
          advertising fees by advertising and linking to products.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-heading text-2xl font-semibold text-text mt-8 mb-4">What This Means</h2>
        <p>
          When we recommend products like pizza ovens, baking steels, scales, or ingredients,
          some of these links are affiliate links. If you click on an affiliate link and make
          a purchase, we may receive a small commission at no additional cost to you.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-heading text-2xl font-semibold text-text mt-8 mb-4">Our Promise</h2>
        <p>
          We only recommend products we genuinely believe are useful for home pizza makers.
          Our recommendations are based on quality, value, and relevance to your pizza-making
          journey — not commission rates.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are never obligated to purchase through our links. We provide them as a convenience
          and as a way to support the free tools we build.
        </p>
