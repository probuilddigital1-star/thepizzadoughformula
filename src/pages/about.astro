          The Pizza Dough Formula is a free calculator that uses baker's percentages to give you precise,
          style-specific dough recipes for Neapolitan, New York, Detroit, and more.

          Great pizza starts with great dough. But getting the ratios right can be confusing,
          especially when every recipe uses different measurements and methods.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-heading text-2xl font-semibold text-text mt-8 mb-4">Why We Built This</h2>
        <p>
          We built The Pizza Dough Formula to solve a simple problem: making it easy for
          anyone to calculate the perfect pizza dough recipe. Whether you're making your
          first pizza or your thousandth, precise measurements make the difference between
          good dough and great dough.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike other calculators that give you generic "pizza dough" formulas, we provide
          style-specific presets. Neapolitan dough is different from New York dough, which is
          different from Detroit dough. Each has optimal hydration levels, ingredient ratios,
          and techniques that make it unique.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-heading text-2xl font-semibold text-text mt-8 mb-4">Baker's Percentages</h2>
        <p>
          We use baker's percentages because they're the language of professional bakers.
          Once you understand that all ingredients are expressed as a percentage of flour
          weight, scaling recipes becomes trivial and comparing formulas becomes intuitive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our calculator shows you both the weights AND the percentages, so you learn as you go.
        </p>
